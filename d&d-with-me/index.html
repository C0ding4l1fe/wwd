This site will tell you all you need to know to get started on a Dungeons and Dragons adventure and find the game for you, both player and Dungeon Master alike.

As for the rest of you, get ready to be introduced to a world of wonders you never knew existed! Let's get on with it, shall we?</p>      
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph">&emsp;Dungeons and Dragons is a TTRPG, or table-top roleplaying game, in which you play, ideally, with a group of friends around a table. You will go on adventures of all kinds, have great fun, and make amazing memories with fast friends. There's nothing like it. A D&D group requires two different roles to be fulfilled in order to work, Players and Dungeon Masters. Players create a character based on who they want the character to be and what they want to be skilled at. After creating the character, a player will then act as that character throughout a large adventurous story crafted by their creativity, in congruence with a Dungeon Master's imagination. Speaking of Dungeon Masters, each group has one Dungeon Master, and it is the Dungeon Master's job to create the worlds and environments the players will go through on their adventures, along with all the beings they will interact with, be they allies or enemy, mortal or immortal, noble or beggar its all up to the DM what sort of people to have in their world. Together, the Dungeon Master and their players will create unforgettable stories, precious memories, fantastical adventures, and a whole lot of fun for all. If you are interested in either of these roles, go to their associated subsections to learn more about just what it takes to fulfill them.</p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Players</h2>
      <p class="home-paragraph">&emsp;If you are interested in being a player, here's what you'll need to know. A player's responsibility is a lot less rigorous than a DM, at least when it comes to time devotion. A players job, after making their character, is acting as them. A character without a personality, without a past, without a soul, is no character at all. You're main job as a character is to see beyond the base mechanics of your character, into who they are as a person. Your main job is to act and behave as your character, rather than who you are. You come up with a backstory, the story of your character before their adventure begins, and their personality. While in the game, need to do your best to play the part of your character, and do what they would do, rather than what you'd like to do. Doing this will help you to have more fun than you would otherwise, and forge an amazing story you'll love to look back on for years to come.</p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Dungeon Masters</h2>
      <p>&emsp;A Dungeon Master's job is to make the world the players interact with, the people they interact with, and the story that they will interact with and create with your help. You make the villains, conflicts and trials that the players will have to go through, whether those things were set up because of player choices or outside forces is up to you. But if you are interested in being a Dungeon Master, or DM, lets just say you'll have a lot of work cut out for you. Well actually there's two different ways you could DM, one doesn't require near as much work, and is probably the best idea for beginners. There are books you can buy that have pre-made worlds and NPCs(or non-player characters) and stories. You can do this, and maybe add your own spin on certain things as a beginning DM, and see how you like it without devoting so much effort to it. The other way you can DM is all on your own. This is called homebrewing. You can make your own world, with its own environments, peoples, cultures and economies. You can also make your own npcs. As a homebrewing DM, you also are allowed much more creative license as to the creation of the story you send the players on, and how to react to their choices. You'll learn how to improvise when your players do things you wouldn't expect to a much greater extent than you'll need with a pre-made book. I believe its a lot more fun and imaginative and gives the DM a lot more control to do a homebrew game rather than a pre-made, but whatever you're comfortable with, feel free to do.</p>
