      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose here at D&D with Me is to introduce newcommers to the fun and adventure of Dungeons and Dragons, while making it easy for players old and new to find any local Dungeon Masters, and gain access to their services, whether paid or unpaid.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is young adults and older teens, who want to have some adventure and fun in their life. It is also aimed towards all those who already know about and like D&D, but have trouble finding a Dungeon Master to run their games. The site will allow Dungeon Masters to volunteer their services, both paid and unpaid, and players to hire them or join their groups. If it is paid, they can have acess to different plans that vary based on the desired frequency of meetings, and the number of players you'd like to have the Dungeon Master run a game for.</p>

      <p>Welcome all to D&D With Me! If you've come to learn about an amazing game and have a lot of fun, this is the place for you! This site will tell you all you need to know to get started on a Dungeons and Dragons adventure and find the game for you, both player and Dungeon Master alike. For those of you, who already know the game, I'd like to direct you to our subsidiary pages, to either hire the Dungeon Master of your dreams or sign up as a Dungeon Master to find the players of your dreams. As for the rest of you, get ready to be introduced to a world of wonders you never knew existed! Let's get on with it, shall we?</p>      
      <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
      <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a TTRPG, or table-top roleplaying game, in which you play, ideally, with a group of friends around a table. You will go on adventures of all kinds, have great fun, and make amazing memories with fast friends. There's nothing like it. A D&D group requires two different roles to be fulfilled in order to work, Players and Dungeon Masters. Players create a character based on who they want the character to be and what they want to be skilled at. After creating the character, a player will then act as that character throughout a large adventurous story crafted by their creativity, in congruence with a Dungeon Master's imagination. Speaking of Dungeon Masters, each group has one Dungeon Master, and it is the Dungeon Master's job to create the worlds and environments the players will go through on their adventures, along with all the beings they will interact with, be they allies or enemy, mortal or immortal, noble or beggar its all up to the DM what sort of people to have in their world. Together, the Dungeon Master and their players will create unforgettable stories, precious memories, fantastical adventures, and a whole lot of fun for all. If you are interested in either of these roles, go to their associated subsections to learn more about just what it takes to fulfill them.</p>
