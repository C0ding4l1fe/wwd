      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Our purpose here at D&D with Me is to introduce newcommers to the fun and adventure of Dungeons and Dragons, while making it easy for players old and new to find any local Dungeon Masters, and gain access to their services, whether paid or unpaid.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is young adults and older teens, who want to have some adventure and fun in their life. It is also aimed towards all those who already know about and like D&D, but have trouble finding a Dungeon Master to run their games. The site will allow Dungeon Masters to volunteer their services, both paid and unpaid, and players to hire them or join their groups. If it is paid, they can have acess to different plans that vary based on the desired frequency of meetings, and the number of players you'd like to have the Dungeon Master run a game for.</p>

      <h1>Welcome to D&D With Me</h1>
      <p>Welcome all to D&D With Me! If you've come to learn about an amazing game and have a lot of fun, this is the place for you! This site will tell you all you need to know to get started on a Dungeons and Dragons adventure and find the game for you, both player and Dungeon Master alike. For those of you, who already know the game, I'd like to direct you to our subsidiary pages, to either hire the Dungeon Master of your dreams or sign up as a Dungeon Master to find the players of your dreams. As for the rest of you, get ready to be introduced to a world of wonders you never knew existed! Let's get on with it, shall we?</p>      
      <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
      <p>Dungeons and Dragons is a TTRPG, or table-top roleplaying game, in which you play, ideally, with a group of friends around a table. You will go on adventures of all kinds, have great fun, and make amazing memories with fast friends. There's nothing like it. A D&D group requires two different roles to be fulfilled in order to work, Players and Dungeon Masters. Players create a character based on who they want the character to be and what they want to be skilled at. After creating the character, a player will then act as that character throughout a large adventurous story crafted by their creativity, in congruence with a Dungeon Master's imagination. Speaking of Dungeon Masters, each group has one Dungeon Master, and it is the Dungeon Master's job to create the worlds and environments the players will go through on their adventures, along with all the beings they will interact with, be they allies or enemy, mortal or immortal, noble or beggar its all up to the DM what sort of people to have in their world. Together, the Dungeon Master and their players will create unforgettable stories, precious memories, fantastical adventures, and a whole lot of fun for all. If you are interested in either of these roles, go to their associated subsections to learn more about just what it takes to fulfill them.</p>      
      <h2>Players</h2>
      <p>If you are interested in being a player, here's what you'll need to know. A player's responsibility is a lot less rigorous than a DM, at least when it comes to time devotion. A players job, after making their character, is acting as them. A character without a personality, without a past, without a soul, is no character at all. You're main job as a character is to see beyond the base mechanics of your character, into who they are as a person. Your main job is to act and behave as your character, rather than who you are. You come up with a backstory, the story of your character before their adventure begins, and their personality. While in the game, need to do your best to play the part of your character, and do what they would do, rather than what you'd like to do. Doing this will help you to have more fun than you would otherwise, and forge an amazing story you'll love to look back on for years to come.</p>
      <h2>Dungeon Masters</h2>
      <p>A Dungeon Master's job is to make the world the players interact with, the people they interact with, and the story that they will interact with and create with your help. You make the villains, conflicts and trials that the players will have to go through, whether those things were set up because of player choices or outside forces is up to you. But if you are interested in being a Dungeon Master, or DM, lets just say you'll have a lot of work cut out for you. Well actually there's two different ways you could DM, one doesn't require near as much work, and is probably the best idea for beginners. There are books you can buy that have pre-made worlds and NPCs(or non-player characters) and stories. You can do this, and maybe add your own spin on certain things as a beginning DM, and see how you like it without devoting so much effort to it. The other way you can DM is all on your own. This is called homebrewing. You can make your own world, with its own environments, peoples, cultures and economies. You can also make your own npcs. As a homebrewing DM, you also are allowed much more creative license as to the creation of the story you send the players on, and how to react to their choices. You'll learn how to improvise when your players do things you wouldn't expect to a much greater extent than you'll need with a pre-made book. I believe its a lot more fun and imaginative and gives the DM a lot more control to do a homebrew game rather than a pre-made, but whatever you're comfortable with, feel free to do.</p>
      <h3>Signing Up and Hiring</h3>
      <p>Now that you've made your decision and know what you're in for, please feel free to visit one of our other pages to help in assembling a game to play in. Aspiring DMs need only sign up on our Dungeon Master Sign Up page, to be notified when players select them on the Dungeon Master Hiring Page. You choose what your rates for hiring will be, and whether or not you will accept a position when offered to you by a player. Players need only visit the Dungeon Master Hiring page, to find a wide selection of Dungeon Masters to choose from, and a wide range of prices and customizations to explore. Enjoy!</p>
