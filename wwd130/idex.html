    <p>Hello all, as said above my name is Jared. I am just a high school student, and I am participating in a sort of dual enrollment, which allows me to take these classes, and get college credit for them. I have four older brothers, and two younger sisters, and live in Peoria Arizona. As many of you could propably guess, about 3/4 of the year, it is boiling and blisteringly hot, but that last quarter, from about late October to mid February, it is beautiful. Temperatures get down to slightly below room temperature during the winter, and I can actually sweat without the moisture evaporating! In all seriousness though, it is a wonderful place to live! </p>

    <p>As a high school student, I have no major, but I have a lot of hobbies I'm lucky enough to have the time for. I love to read, and write fantasy novels. I really love to play Dungeons and Dragons. I am both a player in one group, and a Dungeon Master in another, and love both roles. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for all my life, and it is the thing I love most about my current life.</p>

    <p>As for why I took up this course, and those like it, it is because I want to make videos, websites, and other creative things on the internet, and knowing how to code even the simplest of sites would help in those goals.</p>
    <p>I am truly glad to be a part of this class, and to be here with all of you. I'm excited to see where this goes. Thanks for reading my page all the way through! Good bye!</p>
